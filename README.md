# Graph X 

“If we don’t think about the future in and with all the transformative regions of the world, then we are not thinking about the future.”
– Mark Wigley, Dean GSAPP

Studio X is a new platform that "thinks about the future in and with all the transformative region". A platform for transformation should have an equally transformative graphic interface for the rest of the world.
Graph X is your visual guide to what is happening in Studio Xs around the world, it takes the pulse of the satellite offices of Studio X physically and figuratively. Sight, sound, humidity and Temperature are taken by respective sensors, encode and uploaded to a real time generative graphic on Studio-X website, showing live events as a animated graphic diagrams that comes to life on cyber space. Events information including lecture/discussion live feeds, are enhanced by the graphing of the physical sensory input. providing a sense of the real life experience of the event. Although you might not make it the show in Studio X Rio tonight, but you will see how many people show up, and how hot the room gets once the show started and how vibrant the discussion becomes. Past event data are stored with the website, and you can play it backward to see what had happened in the past. 
These data graphs creates a dynamic pull for internet viewers, designer or not, to create interest in finding out more about these events in the satellite offices, and in turn becoming aware of the organization. Chances are, they will get involve in the next Studio X event, or they will sent their local friends to go for them.
