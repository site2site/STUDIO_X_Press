When we meet on Monday or Tuesday you should know which content platform you want to use. I suggest you stick with something well known like Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram. Be sure to look on https://npmjs.org/ and search for the platform you choose to make sure there is a Node.js module to connect to it's API.

Each content platform has it's own flavor, a specific content format (square image for Instagram, 140 characters for Twitter...), an audience, a frequency, a tone and even a geographic dominance. You should have a reason for choosing the content platform that keeps this in mind and exploits it. You may also want to choose a platform that is not America specific, such as Weibo, which has Node modules https://npmjs.org/search?q=weibo. 

Your task is to explain to us what kind of content is getting produced, how it's getting produced, where it's going (Tumblr, youtube, Google+, Weibo...), at what frequency, and VERY IMPORTANTLY who might want to consume your content and why.
