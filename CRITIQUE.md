Your project appends new forms of information to Studio-X events in order to produce a new online user interface for Studio-X events based on sorting by this information. You will build out a database that pulls in Studio-X event information from the GSAPP events [calendar](events.gsapp.org) and pairs it with information pulled from the space itself during the event, starting with climatic data such as temperature and pressure.

You will build a web site that will allow the user to sort Studio-X events by the strange traits that you will collect. For instance, they will be able to sort by all events that occurred in a room with a temperature above 85ยบ F.

Later, you can also try to pull in data from online sources that will allow you to include other random information like the number of sun spots on the day of the event, astrology information, horoscope, top news stories, etc.

The Studio Analytics group will prepare a grid backbone that you will tap into to add your sensors.

When we meet on Monday or Tuesday you should know which content platform you want to use. I suggest you stick with something well known like Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram. Be sure to look on https://npmjs.org/ and search for the platform you choose to make sure there is a Node.js module to connect to it's API.

Each content platform has it's own flavor, a specific content format (square image for Instagram, 140 characters for Twitter...), an audience, a frequency, a tone and even a geographic dominance. You should have a reason for choosing the content platform that keeps this in mind and exploits it. You may also want to choose a platform that is not America specific, such as Weibo, which has Node modules https://npmjs.org/search?q=weibo. 

Your task is to explain to us what kind of content is getting produced, how it's getting produced, where it's going (Tumblr, youtube, Google+, Weibo...), at what frequency, and VERY IMPORTANTLY who might want to consume your content and why.
