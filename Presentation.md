 Studio X means a studio defined by its 4 walls and ceiling within which anything could happen.  The space of a Studio X event is associated with a series of physical condition of the local weather, temperature, and even humidity, together they enrich your experience of the event. While the events are often nicely documented, the spatial experience from the events are barely touched on by any of its media effort. Now imagine the spaces of these studios would actually twit about the event in their own perspective, and document the event by it's environmental thresholds, a space with vocality emerges as a press service that reverse the object and subject in the usual architectural conversation. 

 Sound, humidity and temperature sensors are embeded in main event spaces inside Studio X, and takes reading in real time, send out event related messages that combined with weather information and greetings. "environmental messages + event inforation" eg. "Temperature in downtown New York is in the mid 80s, relative humidity about 40 to 50%, zero chance of rain, come on down to the eight o'clock presentation of Site2Site project."

Concept 2: Streaming Screen
---
##  Concept

### Give the "language" back to designers in teleconferences.

Content sharing is crucial to remote collaboration, especially in brainstorm and group discussion. But nowadays, most of the teleconference systems are designed only to exchange information in voice and image. For designers, drawing and modeling are also the fundamental languages, which can be hardly communicated through microphone and camera. 

We will propose an app or system to let designers draw, annotate and modeling along with presentation in the teleconference. By connecting the handheld/laptop devices with the projector and the teleconference system, content on each device will be streamed onto the screen locally and remotely, which would make the conversation more efficient and accurate like that in a face-to-face meeting.


## Operation

### The system will base on many existing technology and software. But all of those will be reorganized into a compact interface.

## Modeling on iPad

### Autodesk has developed several apps to support 3d modeling work on touch scree. The FormIt has already get the Ver 2.0.
