 Studio X means a studio defined by its 4 walls and ceiling within which anything could happen.  The space of a Studio X event is associated with a series of physical condition of the local weather, temperature, and even humidity, together they enrich your experience of the event. While the events are often nicely documented, the spatial experience from the events are barely touched on by any of its media effort. Now imagine the spaces of these studios would actually twit about the event in their own perspective, and document the event by it's environmental thresholds, a space with vocality emerges as a press service that reverse the object and subject in the usual architectural conversation. 

 Scenario 1: 

 Sound, humidity and temperature sensors are embeded in main event spaces inside Studio X, and takes reading in real time, send out event related messages that combined with weather information and greetings. "environmental messages + event inforation" eg. "Temperature in downtown New York is in the mid 80s, relative humidity about 40 to 50%, zero chance of rain, come on down to the eight o'clock presentation of Site2Site project."
